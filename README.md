TrafficGenerator
======
This tool can be used to generate real(Autogenerated) traffic on a specific website (domain). It uses the headless browser phantomjs, so that all content will be rendered similar to a real browser, making it hardly to distinguish. 
HTTP proxy lists and random user agents are also supported. 

After visiting a page the tool will randomly select one link from the page and click on it. Only links from the same domain are visisted.

## Usage 
The usage should be quite simple.

```
$> curl  http://txt.proxyspy.net/proxy.txt -o- | grep '+ $'| awk -F' ' '{print $1}' | sort -R > proxies.txt
```
